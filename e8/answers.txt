1) The kNN transformed model seemed to have performed the best out of all the options. It succeeds in detecting colors that are close to each other in the color wheel.
kNN may have performed better since kNN is based on proximity of values, and the RGB color space is already organized as a distance to red, blue, and green.
Although the two kNN models performed close, the LAB model performed marginally better, this is potentially due to rgb2lab acting as a scaling function similar to PCA.

2) Many of the mistakes made by the model in validation data seem reasonable. For example, Victoria -> Vancouver, Portland -> Seattle, Regina -> Calgary, or San Francisco -> Los Angeles.
Most of the cities errorneously identified are close in geographical distance and climate. Hence, the data would be enough to each other to potentially make errors in prediction.
To reduce the amount of wrong predictions, some historical statistics may be useful, since the additional data may make the cities different enough from the model's perspective.
