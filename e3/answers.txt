1) Using Kalman smoothing seemed to have yielded the better results. 
Although certain parameters would result in an underestimate overall, the overall curve seemed to better
represent the actual trends in the CPU temperature data. For example, where the temperature would have spikes but a general upward trend (high but short cpu load),
the Kalman smoothing resulted in better representation without having the entire data be unsmooth.

2) Direction and speed can certainly help because when combined it provides data for velocity.
Velocity and position data can be used together for example including velocity into the kalman smoothing can provide data that is
less prone to random positional jumps, therefore providing more accurate data.
