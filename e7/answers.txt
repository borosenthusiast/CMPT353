Visually inspecting the residual histogram shows a normally distributed plot with left skew, which should be enough to consider the OLS p value. The p-value indicates that y does not linearly depend on x.
So we can conclude that the data given has increasing ratings.
2)
Yes, it appears to capture the actual CPU temperature more than the original. Extreme outliers are still ignored, while allowing for sharper fluctuations in temperature which could be caused by
a high short load on the CPU.
