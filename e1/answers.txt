1) NumPy was initially easier to work with, due to themethods being more direct and simpler to work with. However, Pandas allows for more powerful methods and code that is
more concise. Pandas is also easier to read due to the higher level of code that only describes the process without every step in between (such as ravel and reshape).

2) 
pivot_months_pandas(data):
14 ms ± 39.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
pivot_months_loops(data):
475 ms ± 1.52 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

The standard python loop method has many function calls which all have overhead slowing down the execution time as well as standard python data structures
and methods (dict and list), while the Pandas methods are very optimized and purpose built to handle large amounts of data.
