1) The sqrt transformation provided the closest value because the p value produced by the levene test was > 0.05, which fails
to reject the null hypothesis, showing that the variances are close enough to use these values.

2) For the first T test, if the null hypothesis is rejected then we can conclude that the means of the number of comments on weekends and weekdays are different.
For the second, if the null hypothesis is rejected then the conlusion is that the mean of the square root of number of comments on weekends and weekdays are different.

3) The Mann-Whittney U Test. It is a valid test for this set of data - with different variances with most transformation values and is valid for data that does not follow a standard distribution. The conclusion that
the u test can give is still valid in answering the initial question of there being different number of Reddit comments on weekends vs weekdays.

4) There are more comments on weekdays than on weekends.
