1)
reddit-0 dataset: 9.892s
reddit-2 dataset no schema & no caching: 1m7.524s
reddit-2 dataset schema & no caching: 13.874s
reddit-2 dataset schema & caching: 12.459s

2) 
Based on the 9.892s baseline with a minimal dataset, it would seem like most of the time taken
is reading in the dataset. A larger dataset with equivalent parameters (no caching, with schema)
showed a 4 second increase in total execution time.

3)
.cache() was used after filtering the data from wikipedia, on wiki_clean.
Caching wiki_clean -> 8.585s
No cache -> 8.769s
Caching most_frequently_accessed after agg -> 9.042s
